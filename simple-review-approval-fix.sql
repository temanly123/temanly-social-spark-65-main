-- Simple Review Approval Fix
-- This script fixes the approval issue step by step

-- 1. Check what we have currently
SELECT 'Current state check:' as step;
SELECT 'Profiles:' as info, COUNT(*) as count FROM profiles;
SELECT 'Bookings:' as info, COUNT(*) as count FROM bookings;
SELECT 'Reviews:' as info, COUNT(*) as count FROM reviews;

-- 2. Get profile IDs we'll use
SELECT 'Available profiles:' as step;
SELECT id, name, user_type FROM profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- 3. Fix RLS policies first
SELECT 'Fixing RLS policies:' as step;

-- Drop existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create reviews for their bookings" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Talents can view their reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view verified reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view verified reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_can_create_reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "anyone_can_view_verified_reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_can_view_own_reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "service_role_full_access" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admins_can_manage_all_reviews" ON reviews;

-- Create simple, working policies
CREATE POLICY "allow_all_for_authenticated" ON reviews
FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "allow_select_for_anon" ON reviews
FOR SELECT TO anon
USING (is_verified = true);

-- Ensure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE reviews ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Grant permissions
GRANT ALL ON reviews TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON reviews TO service_role;
GRANT SELECT ON reviews TO anon;

-- 4. Create test data only if needed
