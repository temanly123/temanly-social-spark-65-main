-- Final Review Approval Fix - Matches Current Schema
-- This script works with the actual current database schema

-- 1. Check current table structure first
SELECT 'Checking current schema:' as step;
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'reviews' ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 2. Check what data we currently have
SELECT 'Current data check:' as step;
SELECT 'Profiles:' as info, COUNT(*) as count FROM profiles;
SELECT 'Bookings:' as info, COUNT(*) as count FROM bookings;
SELECT 'Reviews:' as info, COUNT(*) as count FROM reviews;

-- 3. Show available profiles
SELECT 'Available profiles:' as step;
SELECT id, name, user_type FROM profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- 4. Fix RLS policies to allow admin operations
SELECT 'Fixing RLS policies:' as step;
